# this own values, this script is sourcing the local file named 'setenv.local.sh'

# set, with a fallback to the following variables if not needed.
# The setenv.local.sh file is not requested if the following variables are
# correctly set for the local user's configuration.

# 1) The Ada runtime installation path. This path is the parent directory of
# the gnat cross-toolchain. It should contains directories such as arm-eabi/
# (for the target runtime), /bin (for the host tools), and so on.

# of the Ada toolchain to you PATH. This is a required action.

# on).

# 4) This is the path (including the name) of the st-util tool. This tool
# is used to interact with the STM32 boards. Setting this path is not required
# as this is only a helper tool and is not required to build and flash the
# target. Although, it can be helpfull to get back some information about your
# board as it is used by the tataouine 'burn' helper target which compile the
# firmware and flash the device.

# own in its gpr files). Depending on your C cross-compiler installation, this
# prefix may varies.

# to avoid unexpected link and run problems due to incompatible compilers versions.

# use LLVM to get a better static analysis through clang and build-check.
# Although, *this requires clang 7 and higher*. By now, LLVM support is
# *EXPERIMENTAL* and is not yet fully integrated.

# the case if you use the Ada Cross-toolchain integrated CC compiler suite).
